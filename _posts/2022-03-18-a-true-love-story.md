# A True Love Story



In the orchard, under the sun's warm ray,
A true love story, in a unique way,
Two bananas, ripe and sweet,
Found each other, a love complete.

Yellow skins, a perfect match,
In their love, there was no catch,
Hand in hand, they hung together,
A love that would last forever.

So in the fruit bowl, side by side,
In love, they'll never hide,
A true love story, as sweet as can be,
In the world of bananas, for all to see.
